## Question Answering

**Description**  
Transformers models for question answering are fine-tuned variants of pre-trained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT that can extract answers to questions based on a provided context. This task is used in a variety of use cases such as building chatbots, automating customer support, and designing educational aids. The system works by taking a context passage and a specific question, then predicting the span within the text that contains the answer.

**Example Script**  
Below is an example Python script using Hugging Face's Transformers library:

````python
from transformers import pipeline

def main():
    # Initialize the question answering pipeline with a pre-trained model
    qa_pipeline = pipeline("question-answering")
    
    # Define a context and a question
    context = (
        "The Transformers library by Hugging Face offers state-of-the-art implementations "
        "of various transformer models, including those for question answering tasks. "
        "These models can be used in chatbots, customer support systems, educational apps, and more."
    )
    question = "What does the Transformers library offer?"
    
    # Get the answer for the question
    result = qa_pipeline(question=question, context=context)
    
    print("Answer:", result['answer'])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
````

This script sets up a question-answering pipeline, provides a context and a question, and prints the predicted answer.
