Tasks: https://huggingface.co/tasks

The Hugging Face Transformers library provides pipelines for several predefined tasks. Below is a list of common tasks along with a short description of each:

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks

- **Text Classification**  
  Classify texts into predefined categories (e.g., sentiment analysis).

- **Token Classification**  
  Label individual tokens in a sequence for tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or part-of-speech tagging.

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
  Identify and categorize key entities (like persons, organizations, locations, etc.) mentioned in the text.

- **Question Answering**  
  Provide answers to questions based on a given context.

- **Text Generation**  
  Generate coherent and contextually relevant text, useful for tasks like story completion or code generation.

- **Summarization**  
  Generate a concise summary of a longer piece of text.

- **Translation**  
  Translate text from one language to another.

- **Fill-Mask**  
  Predict the missing word (or token) in a sentence where a word has been masked.

- **Zero-Shot Classification**  
  Classify texts into categories that were not seen during training by using contextual inference.

- **Feature Extraction**
  Generate embeddings or hidden representations from texts which can be used for various downstream tasks.

- **Sentence Similarity**
  Determine the similarity between two sentences.
  
- **Table Question Answering**  
  Answer questions related to tabular data.


## Computer Vision Tasks

- **Depth Estimation**  
  Estimate the depth of objects in an image.

- **Image Classification**  
  Classify images into predefined categories.

- **Image Feature Extraction**  
  Extract features from images for use in downstream tasks.

- **Image Segmentation**  
  Segment an image into different regions or objects.

- **Image-to-Image**  
  Transform images from one domain to another.

- **Image-to-Text**  
  Generate textual descriptions from images.

- **Keypoint Detection**  
  Detect key points in images, such as facial landmarks.

- **Mask Generation**  
  Generate masks for objects in images.

- **Object Detection**  
  Detect and localize objects within images.

- **Video Classification**  
  Classify videos into predefined categories.

- **Text-to-Image**  
  Generate images from textual descriptions.

- **Text-to-Video**  
  Generate videos from textual descriptions.

- **Unconditional Image Generation**  
  Generate images without any specific conditions.

- **Zero-Shot Image Classification**  
  Classify images into categories that were not seen during training.

- **Zero-Shot Object Detection**  
  Detect objects in images without having seen examples of those objects during training.

- **Text-to-3D**  
  Generate 3D models from textual descriptions.

- **Image-to-3D**  
  Generate 3D models from images.


## Audio Tasks

- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**  
  Transcribe spoken language into text.

- **Audio Classification**
  Classify audio clips into predefined categories.

- **Audio to audio**
  Convert audio from one domain to another.

- **Text to Speech (TTS)**  
  Convert text into spoken language.


## Multimodal Tasks

- **Any to any**
  Convert data from one modality to another (e.g., text to image, image to text).

- **Audio text to text**
  Convert audio and text inputs to text output.

- **Document question answering**
  Answer questions based on a given document.

- **Visual document retrieval**
  Retrieve documents based on visual queries.

- **Image text to text**
  Convert image and text inputs to text output.

- **Video text to text**
  Convert video and text inputs to text output.

- **Visual question answering**
  Answer questions based on visual input.
